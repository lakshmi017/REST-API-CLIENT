*DESCROIPTION:A REST API client using Java is a Java-based application or component that communicates with RESTful web services over the internet using the HTTP protocol. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources identified by URLs.

The purpose of a REST API client is to send requests to a web server and process the responses, typically formatted in JSON or XML. These clients are widely used in software development for integrating third-party services, accessing backend APIs, or exchanging data between systems.

Java provides several ways to create REST API clients:

HttpURLConnection – A basic Java class used for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses. It’s part of core Java but requires more manual coding.

HttpClient (Java 11+) – A newer, more convenient API introduced in Java 11 that simplifies HTTP communication.

Apache HttpClient – A popular open-source library with more advanced features for managing HTTP connections.

RestTemplate / WebClient – Provided by Spring Framework. These are high-level abstractions used in enterprise applications for REST API consumption.
